Like most in the field, I enjoy problem solving, math, and abstract thinking. I wrote my first program on a Commodore 64 that had a cassette tape drive. I did not formally study computer science as an undergraduate in college (I wish I had!), but somehow got a job in tech during the initial web internet boom in the late 90's. I always wished I could do more but was plenty busy nonetheless. Worse was just not knowing where to go. No big picture. So here I am trying to build the foundation I wish I had from the start. 

It is exciting to participate in a field that is still maturing where  programmers are still figuring out the best way to do things. But at the same time the pace of change is a bit overwhelming. You really can't rest on your laurels or get too comfortable otherwise the whole industry passes you by. I guess it is good to be constantly challenged in that way it makes you stronger and keeps you on your toes. My goal right now is just to secure a well-rounded skill-set and the tools, discipline and knowledge to keep it sharp and useful. 

I am still trying to break through a ceiling of sorts with respect to my training in software engineering. Mid-level cs algoritmn classes are about the point where I really start to struggle. I know I need to shore up my math particulary linear algebra. And be patient. Ideally I would like to have a strong enough foundation in computer science where I could move on to more advanced topics like cryptography or machine learning. I think that is where I want to go.

So in conclusion sofware engineering matches certain talents and interest that I have, is rewarding and challenging and if I do it right might give me the chance to get into some really cool stuff down the road. I can dream right?
